### A transpiler from RockStar to C#

This probably won't be the most amazing transpiler ever but this is how I write compilers.
Currently I am using a tool I wrote called Fastpass to generate the Parser.cs file from Grammer.fpg, I will release Fastpass opensource soon.

This will probably be a bit of a mess for a while.

When I have it working I will make an executable available as well as make an executable for fastpass available.
